#TODO use eureka to discover the URL for the service1 and service2
#TODO configure spring cloud gateway to route the request to downstream services (service1 and service2) based on the paths(/api/greeting, /product)
#TODO for greeting endpoint add a route to accept requests to /greeting but before calling service1 it must append api before the greeting path (HINT: rewrite path filter)
#and method types (GET,POST)
