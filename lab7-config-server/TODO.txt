Create:
1. A new git repository
2. A new application that will be our config server
3. Another application that will be our service that connects to the config server and retrieves properties

The git repository:
1. Contains yml files for multiple environments (profiles): local, dev
2. The yml files contain some properties of your choice - the properties' values should be different among profiles

The config server:
1. Has access to our git repository
2. Shares properties with any service that connects to it
HINT: add spring-cloud-config-server dependency

The service application:
1. Imports the properties from the config server
2. Has some endpoints that use the properties
3. Runs on different profiles (local, dev, none) and uses the according properties
4. If a property is missing, a default value should be specified
